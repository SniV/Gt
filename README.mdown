 The goal of this script is to reduce git commands redundancy.
 Git requirement to write a full command might be a little annoying,
 so this script allows you to write just a few first letters of a Git command.
 For example:
   $ gt st   
 which will mean: git status.
 It's not an analog of Git aliases, it's just a commands shortener.
 If script has a several assumptions of a command it will ask user
 to help to resolve the ambiguity.
